4/4/19 7:24	Maybe a grid was the answer: arbitrary quadrangles that have nothing inherently to do with the land, little to do with history, and not much to do with my details. After all, since the National Survey of 1785, seventy percent of America lies under such a grid, as system of coordinates that has allowed wildness to be subdued. Would coordinates lead to connections? Were they themselves the only links we can truly understand?	William Least Heat-Moon, PrairyErth: A Deep Map (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999).

4/4/19 10:46	I was trying to get them to map the way the land smelled, the way it felt in their legs when they walked it, the way twilight made all the difference.

4/4/19 10:47	The ability to recount multiple realities and to give voice to multiple groups is a critical element in deep mapping and spatial storytelling for it begins to break down the considerable emphasis given to meta-narratives and to universal truths.

4/4/19 10:48	I'm in quest of the land and what informs it, and I'm here because of shadows in me, loomings about threats to America that are alive here too, but things I hope will show more clearly in the spareness of this county.

4/4/19 10:49	It wasn't a project for which some maps were made for illustrative purposes. It was a project in which the mapping insisted on the collecting of data and the asking of questions and the drafting of maps, which in turn insisted on the collection of further data, on the asking of further questions, on the drafting of further maps. This never really ended.	Denis Wood, ‚ÄúMapping Deeply,‚Äù Humanities 4, no. 3 (August 6, 2015): 304‚Äì18, https://doi.org/10.3390/h4030304.	None	Deep mapping project	Nicole Connell
4/4/19 10:49	People connect themselves to the land as their imaginations allow. The links of Chase countians to Jacobs' Mound, at least man earlier time, were more calligraphic than auricular, and at my feet lay proof: a piece of limestone, palm-sized and flattened like a slate and cut into it a reversed J surmounted by an upside-down V: perhaps a cattle brand.

4/4/19 10:49	We began to imagine that (an) atlas could be attractive - not just a jumble of maps- and this really pushed us to think about... structure. Structure? It forced us to think about neighborhoods, about what they were, how they functioned, what they did.	Denis Wood, ‚ÄúMapping Deeply,‚Äù Humanities 4, no. 3 (August 6, 2015): 304‚Äì18, https://doi.org/10.3390/h4030304.	None	Structure, form and function, deep map	JP Beaty
4/4/19 10:54	What is clear about thin maps is that while the map content may be rich in specific ways, the inability to disentangle multiple realities represents a serious challenge to its effectiveness as a deep map on its own. Mapping and tracking these multiple pathways, truths, realities, and the multivocality of the deep map is no easy matter to accomplish. 	Trevor M.

4/4/19 11:14	We live in a spectacular society, that is, our whole life is surrounded by an immense accumulation of spectacles. Things that were once directly lived are now lived by proxy. Once an experience is taken out of the real world it becomes a commodity. As a commodity the spectacular is developed to the detriment of the real. It becomes the substitute for experience.

4/7/19 20:16	Deep maps reflect the complex interaction of the physical and human environments and their relations and behaviors that are nuanced, nonlinear, branching, and so very difficult to map. In many ways, deep maps seek to "map" the unmappable and therein lies the challenge. 	Trevor M.

4/18/19 0:38	The humanities pose far greater epistemological and ontological issues that challenge the technology in a number of ways, from the imprecision and uncertainty of data to concepts of relative space, the use of time as an organizing principle, and the mutually constitutive relationship between time and space.
