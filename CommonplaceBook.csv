There seemed to be plenty of opportunities, and some even declared that Norway had become an America. Good times, good crops, rising prices on grain and other farm products led to increased activity and greater job opportunities in the rural communities. Great road and railway construction jobs were undertaken by the state; wages rose considerably. Then came the 1860s with years of poor crops and falling prices.","Semmingsen, Ingrid, and Einar Haugen. Norway to America. NED-New edition.

Here immigrants were welcomed and encouraged to settle. The states of the Midwest, such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, established public offices with functionaries whose business it was to guide newcomers from Europe to their territories.","Semmingsen, Ingrid, and Einar Haugen.
